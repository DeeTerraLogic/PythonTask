import sys: This line imports the sys module, which provides access to some variables and functions that are used or maintained by the interpreter.

import os: This line imports the os module, which provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality.

import psutil: This line imports the psutil module, which provides an interface for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization.

def check_process_running(process_name): This line defines a function named check_process_running that takes a process_name parameter.

for process in psutil.process_iter(['name']): This line starts a loop that iterates over all running processes, using the psutil.process_iter() function. The ['name'] argument specifies that we only want to retrieve the process name for each process.

if process.info['name'] == process_name: This line checks if the process name of the current iteration matches the desired process_name that was passed as an argument.

return True: This line returns True if the process is found.

return False: This line returns False if the process is not found after iterating over all processes.

if __name__ == "__main__": This line checks if the script is being run as the main module. This allows the code inside this block to execute when the script is run directly, but not when it is imported as a module.

process_name = "chrome.exe": This line sets a default value for the process_name variable. This value will be used if no command-line argument is provided.

if len(sys.argv) >= 2: This line checks if there are command-line arguments provided. The sys.argv list contains the command-line arguments passed to the script.

process_name = sys.argv[1]: This line assigns the value of the first command-line argument to the process_name variable.

if check_process_running(process_name): This line calls the check_process_running function passing the process_name variable as an argument. It then checks if the function returns True, indicating that the process is running.

print(f"The process '{process_name}' is still running."): This line prints a message to the console indicating that the process is still running.

print(f"The process '{process_name}' is not running."): This line prints a message to the console indicating that the process is not running.
